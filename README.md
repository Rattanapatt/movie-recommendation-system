# Recommendation System

## 3 Types of Recommendation Systems
1. **Popularity-based**: Recommends items based on overall popularity among all users.
2. **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends items based on the user’s past interactions and similar users’ preferences (user-user or item-item).
3. **Content-based Filtering**: Recommends items by analyzing the content or attributes of the items themselves and matching them to user preferences.

## Libraries Used in This Project
1. `pandas`: To manage and manipulate data in the form of DataFrames.
2. `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms, including content-based filtering and evaluation metrics.
3. `scikit-surprise`: Specialized for collaborative filtering, particularly for matrix factorization and recommendation algorithms such as SVD.
